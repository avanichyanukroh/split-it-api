# split-it-api
Split-it API was created to convert JSON data provided by Google's Cloud Vision API. The algorithm maps out the parsed characters into an itemized list to be used for users to easily split bills.

Split-it API was created in conjunction with the iOS App for the LA-Hacks 2019 Hackathon.

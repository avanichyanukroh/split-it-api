# split-it-api
Split-it API was created to map JSON data provided by Google's Cloud Vision API. The algorithm maps out the parsed characters into an itemized list to be used by the iOS app so users can easily split bills.

Split-it API was created in conjunction with the iOS App for the LA-Hacks 2019 Hackathon.
